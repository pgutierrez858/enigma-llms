            "name": "The Rape of Proserpine",
            "description": "Peter Paul Rubens\u2019 'The Rape of Proserpine' (c. 1636) vividly captures the dramatic abduction of Proserpine by Pluto, who forcefully carries her to the underworld. The painting is filled with movement and tension, as Proserpine struggles while being taken into Pluto\u2019s chariot, her terror evident in her expression and posture. Rubens\u2019 dynamic brushwork, rich colors, and striking contrasts between light and shadow heighten the emotional intensity of the scene. His powerful depiction of the human form and masterful use of Baroque drama emphasize themes of power, violence, and vulnerability. The work remains a celebrated interpretation of classical mythology, showcasing Rubens\u2019 ability to merge storytelling with visual grandeur.",
